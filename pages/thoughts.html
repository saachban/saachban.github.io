                    <p>Saachi... You are truly one of the most talented girls I have ever met. Since the time I have met you, I have always seen the wonders that you leave behind with your art. You truly mesmerize everyone with your art and dance. I pray that God blesses with you so much motivation to keep doing what you do. I'm sure that one day, you will definitely be very successful in both these fields.<br> <span class="stress">Keep Dancing and Painting, Saach!</span></p>

There has never been a single moment during which I required your help and care where you did not give a supporting hand. You have always seen good in others and never bad. You have always done this in relation to me as well. I thank you for that with all my heart. I will always strive to learn from your good spirit and provide the same support for you too! <br><span class="stress">Always stay like this @Saachi!</span></p>

I love you for the same. Every time that I was hurting, you were there to provide some consolation.... Every time that I was feeling sad, you were there to cheer me up... Whenever I needed someone, you were always there. No matter where we are, I hope that I will always be able to do the same for you - be a support and a part of your life!. Thank you for everything that you have done for me. You are my closest friend and companion. I hope that our relationship only grows stronger with the years! <span class="stress">Thank you Saach!</span></p>
